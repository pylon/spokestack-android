# Spokestack Android

Spokestack provides an extensible speech recognition pipeline for the Android
platform. It includes a variety of built-in speech processors for Voice
Activity Detection (VAD) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) via popular
speech recognition services such as the Google Speech API and Azure Speech
API.

See the [documentation](https://spokestack.io/docs) for a lot more information
than is in this brief introduction.

## Configuration

### Google Speech API

```java
SpeechPipeline pipeline = new SpeechPipeline.Builder()
    .useProfile("io.spokestack.spokestack.profile.VADTriggerGoogleASR")
    .setProperty("google-credentials", "<google-credentials>")
    .setProperty("locale", "en-US")
    .build();
```

This example uses a pre-built profile to create a speech recognition pipeline triggered by VAD
that uses the Google Speech API for speech recognition. The `google-credentials` parameter should
be the contents of a Google Cloud service account credentials file, in JSON
format. For more information, see the [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/speech/docs/streaming-recognize).
See the [javadoc](https://javadoc.io/doc/io.spokestack/spokestack-android) for
other component-specific configuration parameters.

### Wakeword Detection
```java
SpeechPipeline pipeline = new SpeechPipeline.Builder()
    .useProfile("io.spokestack.spokestack.profile.TFWakewordGoogleASR")
    .setProperty("wake-filter-path", "<tensorflow-lite-filter-path>")
    .setProperty("wake-encode-path", "<tensorflow-lite-encode-path>")
    .setProperty("wake-detect-path", "<tensorflow-lite-detect-path>")
    .setProperty("wake-threshold", 0.85)
    .setProperty("google-credentials", "<google-credentials>")
    .setProperty("locale", "en-US")
    .build();
```

This example creates a wakeword-triggered pipeline with the Google Speech
recognizer. The wakeword trigger uses three trained
[TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/) models: a *filter* model
for spectrum preprocessing, an autoregressive encoder *encode* model, and a
*detect* decoder model for keyword classification. For more information on
the wakeword detector and its configuration parameters, click
[here](https://github.com/spokestack/spokestack-android/wiki/wakeword).

The `wake-threshold` property is set by the `TFWakewordGoogleASR` profile, but it is
overridden here to emphasize that properties set after a profile is applied (either directly
in the builder or by another profile) supersede those set by that profile.

To use the demo "Spokestack" wakeword, download the TensorFlow Lite models: [detect](https://d3dmqd7cy685il.cloudfront.net/model/wake/spokestack/detect.tflite) | [encode](https://d3dmqd7cy685il.cloudfront.net/model/wake/spokestack/encode.tflite) | [filter](https://d3dmqd7cy685il.cloudfront.net/model/wake/spokestack/filter.tflite)

## Development
Maven is used for building/deployment, and the package is hosted at JCenter.

This package requires the [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/index.html)
to be installed and the `ANDROID_HOME` and `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` variables to be
set. On OSX, `ANDROID_HOME` is usually set to `~/Library/Android/sdk` and
`ANDROID_NDK_HOME` is usually set to `~/Library/Android/sdk/ndk/<version>`.

`ANDROID_NDK_HOME` can also be specified in your local Maven `settings.xml` file as the `android.ndk.path` property.

### Testing/Coverage

```bash
mvn test jacoco:report
```

### Lint

```bash
mvn checkstyle:check
```

### Release
Ensure that your Bintray credentials are in your user Maven `settings.xml`:

```xml
<servers>
    <server>
        <id>bintray-spokestack-io.spokestack</id>
        <username>username</username>
        <password>bintray_api_key</password>
    </server>
</servers>
```

On a non-master branch, remove the -SNAPSHOT suffix from the version in `pom.xml`, then run the
following command. This will deploy the package to Bintray and JCenter.

```bash
mvn deploy
```

Revert your above change using `git checkout .`, then use the Maven release plugin to tag the release and advance the version number.

```bash
mvn release:clean release:prepare release:perform
```
